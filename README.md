# Anime-Log

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project to help anime enthusiasts organize a list of anime to watch.

As a fan and consumer of anime, I wanted to make an application that would help me keep a list of all the animes that I wanted to watch in the future as well as track my progress on current animes I am watching.
